# bunqAutomation
This project should become a self hosted, easy to install and user friendly automation tool. Things such as automatically saving a percentage of each payment or automatically sending a request once a month (\*cough\* pack users \*cough\*) should be easy to setup.

Very much under development and NOT ready to be used for anything but sandbox testing!

Feel free to discuss things on [Telegram](https://t.me/bunqCommunity) or [create an issue](https://github.com/bunqCommunity/bunqAutomation/issues/new)

## Project goals

#### Selfhosted
Once the project is stable and useable work on creating one-click apps for popular hosting providers like DigitalOcean and Heroku.

#### Convention over configuration
Both using bunqAutomation and creating more modules/plugins later on should be simple.

#### Secure
Since this project should be useable for less experienced users, we can't guarantee that the servers will remain secure. Making sure no keys and passwords are stored in plain text is important.
